# PesticideExposureVsBoneMineralDensity
Final project for STAT512 Applied Regression Analysis

99/100

This exploration makes use of the NHANES (National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey) to
study the association between exposure to a set of household pesticide chemicals and Bone Mineral
Density (BMD). The research question was therefore “Is there a significant association between
pesticide urine-biomarkers and averaged Spine-Femur Bone Mineral Density?”
Pesticide urine-biomarker levels were adjusted to ensure detection limits were consistent and log
transformed to improve their distribution. The association with Average BMD was tested using several
models and a final model was chosen by forward-backward stepwise selection while including 15
covariates like Age, Gender, and Family Income.
This exploration finds that a 1% increase in urine-biomarker levels of 245-trichlorophenol is associated
with 0.0000024-unit reduction in Average BMD respectively. A unique finding of this exploration was
that women exposed to 246-trichlorophenol were found to be associated with a larger reduction in
BMD than men.
